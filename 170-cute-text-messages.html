I can’t really find the words to explain the way I feel when I hear your voice or when I see your face… all I can say is that I like the feeling.</p><p>49. You are the reason for my smiles!</p><p>50. It’s not my fault I love you so much…it’s yours!</p><p>51. Your hand is my favorite thing to hold…</p><p>52. My love for you is a journey.

You are always on my mind…</p><p>57. In the midst of the most dull things, you make our togetherness insanely fun! Loving you is my most favorite thing to do!</p><p>58. With every passing second, I come that much closer to meeting you tonight. Can’t wait to be in your arms and kiss you.</p><p>59. Every time I close my eyes, I see your sweet face. And whenever I think about us, I can’t help but feel content. I am so happy that we have each other, for better or for worse.</p><p>60. True love does not come by finding the perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly.</p><p>61. I’m not sure what life could bring you. I’m not sure if dreams do come true. I’m not sure what love can do. But I’m sure about one thing. I love you.</p><p>62. Sometimes my eyes get jealous of my heart. Know why? Because you always remain close to my heart and far from my eyes.</p><p>63. When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.</p><p>64. Before I met you I never knew what it was like; to look at someone and smile for no reason.</p><p>65. I wanna write ‘miss you’ on a rock and throw it at your face so you know how much it hurts to miss you.</p><p>66. Good morning sunshine. It’s a brand new day. Everything’s totally different from what it was yesterday, except one thing: my love for you.</p><p>67. It’s been so long but when I see you I still get those all too familiar butterflies in my stomach. I love you more with every passing day. Never ever forget that.</p><p>68. Every day I wake up with a smile on my face. You are the reason for that smile.</p><p>69. Knowing that you are a part of my life makes me feel secure and complete. I feel like I can deal with any obstacle that comes my way as long as I have you, my support-system. You give me immense courage to believe in myself.</p><p>70. You may wonder what’s in a message?
